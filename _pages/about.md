# About Me

I am **Junkai (Jackie) Lin**, currently an undergraduate student in **Data Science** at  
**Beijing Normal – Hong Kong Baptist University (BNBU)**.  
My research interests lie in:

- Machine Learning & Optimization  
- Multimodal & Large Language Models  
- Medical Imaging
- Geo-Infomatics
- Scientific Machine Learning & Diffusion Models  

I have published papers at **ICVRV**, **ICIRA**, **PRICAI**, and am currently leading projects (graduation thesis) on  
gravity-inspired clustering & classification algorithms.
